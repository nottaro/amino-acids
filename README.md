# amino-acids
Code that generates messenger RNA and amino acid based on DNA codes

Hope it works!

For context, DNA is composed of 4 nucleotides:
1. Adenine (A)
2. Thymine (T)
3. Guanine (G)
4. Cytosine (C)

To produce proteins, a string of 3 nucleotides is required. A string of messenger RNA attaches itself to the DNA, and matches each nucleotidde with a corresponding nucleotide. T=A, C=G, G=C, A=U. U is uracil. RNA does not have Thymine, so it uses Uracil.

The 3 nucleotides correspond to a specific protein that is produced by Transcription and Translation.
